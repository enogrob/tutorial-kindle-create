# Tutorial Kindle Create

![tutorial image](images/tutorial.png)

**About**

In this tutorial, you'll use Kindle Create to prepare the interior of a sample book, Jane Austen's classic novel Pride and Prejudice. You'll start with an unformatted manuscript and finish with a file that's ready to be uploaded to KDP. We've provided starting materials and will walk you through each step.

By the end of the tutorial, you'll understand what you can do with Kindle Create and how to use it to prepare your own books.
